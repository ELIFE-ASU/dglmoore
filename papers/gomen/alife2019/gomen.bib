  abstract  = "Collective decision-making systems rely on many agents to
               gather, process and exchange information to arrive at a group
               decision. Critical to group success is the transfer of
               information among agents and between agents and their
               environment. Without information transfer, no consensus can be
               achieved. Yet, the role of individual rules in determining
               information transfer at the group level is poorly understood.
               With the aim to shed a light on how the decision mechanism of
               individuals affects information transfer in collectives, we
               analyze the information landscape of two decision-making
               strategies: one based on the majority rule and one based on the
               voter model. For each strategy, we consider a binary
               site-selection scenario and use transfer entropy to measure the
               flow of information in a spatial, multi-agent system. We find
               that information transferred among agents is dependent on the
               decision mechanism, increases with the time necessary to make a
               collective decision, and is loosely modulated by the uncertainty
               of the final outcome. This is the first study that compares
               collective decision making mechanisms through the lens of
               information dynamics. Although this approach is limited to
               simulated agents, similar approaches could in principle be used
               to study collective decisions in biological systems.",

                   their previous experiences and outcomes. Accordingly, we
                   introduce a framework based on evolutionary games where
                   individuals have the capacity to perceive their interactions
                   in different ways. Starting from the narrative of social
                   behaviors in a pub as an illustration, we first study the
                   combination of the prisoner's dilemma and harmony game as
                   two alternative perceptions of the same situation.
                   Considering a selection of game pairs, our results show that
                   the interplay between perception dynamics and game payoffs
                   gives rise to non-linear phenomena unexpected in each of the
                   games separately, such as catastrophic phase transitions in
                   the cooperation basin of attraction, Hopf bifurcations and
                   cycles of cooperation and defection. Combining analytical

                   introducing individual perceptions can cause non-trivial
                   dynamical behaviors to emerge, which cannot be obtained by
                   analyzing the system as a whole. Specifically, initial

               processes that produce such observations, calls for a rigorous
               and efficient method of causal network inference. Here we
               develop mathematical theory of causation entropy, an
               information-theoretic statistic designed for model-free
               causality inference. For stationary Markov processes, we prove
               that for a given node in the network, its causal parents form
               the minimal set of nodes that maximizes causation entropy, a
               result we refer to as the optimal causation entropy principle.
               Furthermore, this principle guides us in developing

  abstract = "Transfer entropy (TE) is an information-theoretic measure which
              has received recent attention in neuroscience for its potential
              to identify effective connectivity between neurons. Calculating
              TE for large ensembles of spiking neurons is computationally
              intensive, and has caused most investigators to probe neural
              interactions at only a single time delay and at a message length
              of only a single time bin. This is problematic, as synaptic
              delays between cortical neurons, for example, range from one to
              tens of milliseconds. In addition, neurons produce bursts of
              spikes spanning multiple time bins. To address these issues, here
              we introduce a free software package that allows TE to be
              measured at multiple delays and message lengths. To assess
              performance, we applied these extensions of TE to a spiking
              cortical network model (Izhikevich, 2006) with known connectivity
              and a range of synaptic delays. For comparison, we also
              investigated single-delay TE, at a message length of one bin
              (D1TE), and cross-correlation (CC) methods. We found that D1TE
              could identify 36\% of true connections when evaluated at a false
              positive rate of 1\%. For extended versions of TE, this
              dramatically improved to 73\% of true connections. In addition,
              the connections correctly identified by extended versions of TE
              accounted for 85\% of the total synaptic weight in the network.
              Cross correlation methods generally performed more poorly than
              extended TE, but were useful when data length was short. A
              computational performance analysis demonstrated that the
              algorithm for extended TE, when used on currently available
              desktop computers, could extract effective connectivity from 1 hr
              recordings containing 200 neurons in ∼5 min. We conclude that
              extending TE to multiple delays and message lengths improves its
              ability to assess effective connectivity between spiking neurons.
              These extensions to TE soon could become practical tools for
              experimentalists who record hundreds of spiking neurons.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: There is variability in the cancer phenotype across
              individuals: two patients with the same tumour may experience
              different disease life histories, resulting from genetic
              variation within the tumour and from the interaction between
              tumour and host. Until now, phenotypic variability has precluded
              a clear-cut identification of the fundamental characteristics of
              a given tumour type. METHODS: Using multiple myeloma as an
              example, we apply the principles of evolutionary game theory to
              determine the fundamental characteristics that define the
              phenotypic variability of a tumour. RESULTS: Tumour dynamics is
              determined by the frequency-dependent fitness of different cell
              populations, resulting from the benefits and costs accrued by
              each cell type in the presence of others. Our study shows how the
              phenotypic variability in multiple myeloma bone disease can be
              understood through the theoretical approach of a game that allows
              the identification of key genotypic features in a tumour and
              provides a natural explanation for phenotypic variability. This
              analysis also illustrates how complex biochemical signals can be
              translated into cell fitness that determines disease dynamics.
              CONCLUSION: The present paradigm is general and extends well
              beyond multiple myeloma, and even to non-neoplastic disorders.
              Furthermore, it provides a new perspective in dealing with cancer
              eradication. Instead of trying to kill all cancer cells,
              therapies should aim at reducing the fitness of malignant cells
              compared with normal cells, allowing natural selection to
              eradicate the tumour.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Tumour progression has been described as a sequence
              of traits or phenotypes that cells have to acquire if the
              neoplasm is to become an invasive and malignant cancer. Although
              genetic mutations that lead to these phenotypes are random, the
              process by which some of these mutations become successful and
              cells spread is influenced by tumour microenvironment and the
              presence of other cell phenotypes. It is thus likely that some
              phenotypes that are essential in tumour progression will emerge
              in the tumour population only with prior presence of other
              different phenotypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we
              use evolutionary game theory to analyse the interactions between
              three different tumour cell phenotypes defined by autonomous
              growth, anaerobic glycolysis, and cancer cell invasion. The model
              allows us to understand certain specific aspects of glioma
              progression such as the emergence of diffuse tumour cell invasion
              in low-grade tumours. RESULTS: We have found that the invasive
              phenotype is more likely to evolve after appearance of the
              glycolytic phenotype which would explain the ubiquitous presence
              of invasive growth in malignant tumours. CONCLUSIONS: The result
              suggests that therapies, which increase the fitness cost of
              switching to anaerobic glycolysis, might decrease probability of
              the emergence of more invasive phenotypes.",

  abstract = "Evolutionary games have been applied as simple mathematical
              models of populations where interactions between individuals
              control the dynamics. Recently, it has been proposed to use this
              type of model to describe the evolution of tumour cell
              populations with interactions between cells. We extent the
              analysis to allow for synergistic effects between cells. A
              mathematical model of a tumour cell population is presented in
              which population-level synergy is assumed to originate through
              the interaction of triplets of cells. A threshold of two
              cooperating cells is assumed to be required to produce a
              proliferative advantage. The mathematical behaviour of this model
              is explored. Even this simple synergism (minor clustering effect)
              is sufficient to generate qualitatively different cell-population
              dynamics from the models published previously. The most notable
              feature of the model is the existence of an unstable internal
              equilibrium separating two stable equilibria. Thus, cells of a
              malignant phenotype can exist in a stable polymorphism, but may
              be driven to extinction by relatively modest perturbations of
              their relative frequency. The proposed model has some features
              that may be of interest to biological interpretations of gene
              therapy. Two prototypical strategies for gene therapy are
              suggested, both of them leading to extinction of the malignant
              phenotype: one approach would be to reduce the relative
              proportion of the cooperating malignant cell type below a certain
              critical value. Another approach would be to increase the
              critical threshold value without reducing the relative frequency
              of cells of the malignant phenotype.",

              theory frame the tumor-host interface as a dynamical
              microenvironment of competing tumor and normal populations.
              Through this approach, critical parameters that control the
              outcome of this competition are identified and the conditions
              necessary for formation of an invasive cancer are defined.
              Perturbations in these key parameters that destabilize the cancer
              solution of the state equations and produce tumor regression can
              be predicted. The mathematical models demonstrate significant
              theoretical limitations in therapies based solely on cytotoxic
              drugs. Because these approaches do not alter critical parameters
              controlling system dynamics, the tumor population growth term
              will remain positive as long as any individual cells are present
              so that the tumor will invariably recur unless all proliferative
              cells are killed. The models demonstrate that such total
              effectiveness is rendered unlikely by the genotypic heterogeneity
              of tumor populations (and, therefore, the variability of their
              response to such drugs) and the ability of tumor cells to adapt
              to these proliferation constraints by evolving resistant
              phenotypes. The mathematical models support therapeutic
              strategies that simultaneously alter several of the key
              parameters in the state equations. Furthermore, the models
              demonstrate that administration of cytotoxic therapies will, by
              reducing the tumor population density, create system dynamics
              more conducive to perturbations by biological modifiers.",
